# Requested Rolls
This extension allows the GM to send a popup to players for specific specific throws to include the below. You can also set a DC, advantage, and whether to hide the roll in the control window.
* Ability checks
* Saves
* Specific dice
* Initiative
* Death
* Skill checks

Optionally, this extension can cause a dialog to popup for any saving throw required. This means that when a NPC forces a saving throw, the PC is presented a button to click to actually make the roll.  Perfect for those who want to feel like they are rolling instead of Fantasy Grounds doing it for them.
